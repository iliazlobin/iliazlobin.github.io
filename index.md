  I’m a <strong>Principal Software Engineer</strong> in New York City with 12+ years building and operating large-scale distributed systems and cloud-native platforms across AWS, GCP, and Azure. My focus is on architecting infrastructure platforms and automation frameworks that improve developer productivity, ensure reliability, and scale to enterprise demands. I bring deep expertise in AI/ML, integrating AI-driven automation and robust MLOps to accelerate innovation at organizational scale.

## Outside of Work
I try to balance all the tech with a few passions:  
- **Sports & Fitness** — I love working out, running, and keeping active.  
- **Travel & Exploration** — whether it’s conferences, local events, or hopping on a plane to a new city, I enjoy being around ideas and smart people.  
- **Events & Communities** — I often attend (and sometimes speak at) tech conferences and meetups.
