## Career Focus
- **Platform Engineering** — architecting and operating multi-cloud landing zones, enterprise-grade Kubernetes platforms, developer portals, and GitOps-driven workflows at scale.
- **Cloud-Native Infrastructure** — extensive experience with AWS, GCP, and Azure; led organizational migrations of 200+ services across 2,000+ Kubernetes nodes, establishing standardized infrastructure patterns.
- **Distributed Systems** — designing and scaling data pipelines, observability platforms, and developer productivity solutions for organization-wide adoption.

---

## Professional Interests
- **AI & ML Platform Engineering** — architecting scalable training and inference pipelines, agent-based frameworks, GPU-accelerated clusters, and end-to-end orchestration for applied machine learning solutions.  
- **Developer Experience & Productivity** — enabling streamlined development workflows through golden paths, ephemeral environments, and robust self-service platforms that optimize velocity while maintaining governance.  
- **Site Reliability Engineering** — implementing resilient architectures with multi-region disaster recovery, cost optimization strategies, and observability-driven operations to ensure system reliability and performance.

## Outside of Work
I try to balance all the tech with a few passions:  
- **Sports & Fitness** — I love working out, running, and keeping active.  
- **Travel & Exploration** — whether it’s conferences, local events, or hopping on a plane to a new city, I enjoy being around ideas and smart people.  
- **Events & Communities** — I often attend (and sometimes speak at) tech conferences and meetups.
